Security Engineering- Exercises

Task 1 :

Technological Lock-In occurs when a company becomes dependent on a specific technology or system, making it difficult or costly to switch to alternatives. This could be due to high investment in hardware, software, or specialized skills tied to the technology. Once entrenched, switching can be expensive and complex, often requiring retraining staff or restructuring workflows.

Vendor Lock-In is a situation where a customer relies heavily on a single vendor for products or services, limiting flexibility. This typically happens in cloud services or software subscriptions, where the cost of transferring data or adjusting infrastructure to a new vendor can be high. Companies often stick with the vendor to avoid losing the tools or support they rely on.

Breaking free from either lock-in can lead to high switching costs. However, remaining locked in offers the advantage of stability and lower short-term costs. But,  it also creates the risk of a lack of flexibility, and vendor dependency that might suppress innovation.

In my context, lock-ins can limit the scope of choices, restricting my ability to adjust to rapidly growing technologies.

Task 2 :
Phishing attacks exploit cognitive biases such as trust, urgency, and authority, making them effective. People rely on heuristics or mental shortcuts in decision-making, especially when under pressure or faced with seemingly legitimate requests. Phishing emails often imitate trusted brands or people. It triggers automatic responses without deep analysis. This taps into cognitive psychology, where users are prone to ignoring subtle clues like misspellings or incorrect URLs because they focus on the email’s content. Attackers also leverage behavioural psychology, using rewards or threats to produce quick, thoughtless actions, such as clicking a link or downloading an attachment.
Social engineering works because it exploits social psychology principles, particularly the reciprocity and authority biases. Humans are naturally inclined to comply with requests from someone perceived as an authority or empathy is induced. Social engineers often pose as trusted figures, such as IT support or managers, triggering the social norms of trust and cooperation. They manipulate behaviours by creating social pressure, using cognitive dissonance to push individuals to act before critically evaluating the situation. Moreover, our desire to fit into social groups or avoid conflict makes us tolerant of manipulation.
Behavioural psychology plays a major role in password mismanagement. People often prioritize convenience over security, leading them to choose easy-to-remember, weak passwords or reuse passwords across multiple sites. From a cognitive psychology standpoint, humans have limited memory capacity and tend to avoid complex, burdensome tasks like creating and remembering long, unique passwords. Despite awareness of secure practices, the immediate relief of using weak passwords overshadows the perceived risk of a potential violation.

PGP  fails largely due to its complexity, which clashes with typical user behaviour and cognitive limitations. For most people, the encryption process is not intuitive and requires an understanding of public/private key cryptography. Behavioural psychology reveals that users tend to avoid tools that require significant effort to use, even if they provide high security. Additionally, the social aspect of email communication discourages the adoption of unmanageable tools. Even when users are aware of its benefits, conflict in the user experience leads to avoidance.

Malware spreads easily because attackers leverage social and behavioural psychology to exploit common user behaviours and habits. Many users lack the technical knowledge to recognize malicious software, leading them to download and execute malware unknowingly. Cognitive biases, such as optimism bias, and habitual behaviour—like clicking on links or downloading attachments—create fertile ground for malware to propagate. Social engineering tactics, such as offering free downloads or mimicking legitimate software, encourage people to install malicious code without proper scrutiny.

Task 3 A :


Intellectual property refers to the legal rights granted to creators over their inventions, designs, and creative works. It includes patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets.
Apple's IP portfolio includes design patents for its devices and trademarks for its logo.

Copyright is a legal right given to the creator of original works, like literature, music, or art, to control the use and distribution of their work. Copyright protects the expression of ideas, not the ideas themselves, for a specific period.
The movie industry, including studios like Disney, uses copyright to prevent the unauthorized distribution of films.

A patent gives inventors exclusive rights to make, use, or sell their inventions for a limited period, typically 20 years. Patents are granted for inventions that are new, useful, and non-obvious.
 Pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer patent drugs to secure market exclusivity.

A trademark protects brand names, logos, and slogans that distinguish goods or services. It prevents others from using similar marks that could confuse consumers.
Coca-Cola’s iconic logo and brand name are trademarked, preventing other companies from using similar names or designs.

NDAs are legal contracts that prevent parties from sharing confidential information with others. Companies use NDAs to protect trade secrets, product designs, and business strategies during partnerships.
 Tesla often uses NDAs when collaborating with suppliers or employees to protect its proprietary technology.

Watermarks are visible or invisible marks placed on digital or physical media to identify ownership or prevent unauthorized use. They help trace the origin of a file and act as a deterrent for copyright infringement.
Stock photography websites like Shutterstock use watermarks on images to prevent unauthorized use before purchase.

Software licenses are agreements that define how software can be used, distributed, or modified. Licenses can range from open-source to proprietary, which limits user rights.
 Microsoft Windows is distributed with a proprietary software license.

DRM refers to technologies used to control how digital content is accessed and distributed. It restricts copying, sharing, or modifying files, ensuring only authorized users can access the content.
Streaming platforms like Netflix use DRM to prevent users from downloading and distributing movies without permission.

A software protection dongle is a physical device that must be plugged into a computer to use a particular software. It ensures that only users with the dongle can access the software.
 High-end software like CAD programs often use dongles to prevent unauthorized use.

Task 3 B :

In the ongoing debate between intellectual property protection and the desire for free information, some safeguarding methods are sometimes bypassed by various groups or individuals. Two key safeguarding methods that have been challenged are Digital Rights Management (DRM) and Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs). Each has seen high-profile instances where these protections were either broken or bypassed, revealing the tension between security and accessibility.

One notable instance of DRM circumvention involves the digital music industry. In the early 2000s, when iTunes and other music platforms adopted DRM to prevent the unauthorized sharing of purchased songs, a major backlash occurred. Consumers who legally bought music found themselves restricted in how they could use it. For example, they couldn’t easily transfer songs to different devices, which felt unfair to many users. In response, groups of hackers and tech enthusiasts worked to bypass these DRM restrictions. One famous case involved Jon Lech Johansen, also known as "DVD Jon," who in 2003 cracked the DRM on Apple’s FairPlay system, allowing users to remove restrictions from their purchased iTunes music. His action sparked a larger movement, with groups like the Free Software Foundation opposing DRM because it limited consumer freedom.

Johansen and other DRM bypassers justify their actions by arguing that DRM punishes honest consumers rather than preventing piracy. They claim that DRM systems only limit legal users, while pirates find ways to circumvent the protections. In their view, DRM goes against the natural flow of digital content. 

Another method often bypassed is the Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA), which companies use to protect sensitive information. NDAs are designed to prevent employees,  and partners from leaking confidential data. However,  activists sometimes break these agreements when they believe the public has a right to know about unethical activities.

A famous example occurred in 2013 when Edward Snowden, a former contractor for the National Security Agency (NSA), leaked classified documents. Snowden had signed multiple NDAs during his employment, but he chose to bypass these agreements. Snowden justified his actions by arguing that the public deserved to know about the widespread violation of privacy rights. He believed the government’s activities were illegal and that the need for transparency overshadowed the legal obligations of the NDA.

Both cases show how safeguarding methods like DRM and NDAs can be bypassed when people believe the protections are unjust. Those who bypass these protections often position themselves as defenders of freedom and public interest. While their actions are controversial and often illegal, they reveal the tension between the desire to protect information and the belief that information should be free.
